## üì¶ Dataset Simulation

> **The CSRD simulation framework code is open-source. However, the specific 2000TB CSRD2025 dataset instance characterized herein is not hosted for direct download due to the prohibitive costs associated with storage and bandwidth for data of this scale. This large dataset size is primarily because the default configuration file `config/_base_/simulate/ChangShuo/CSRD2025.json` sets `"NumFrames": 100000000`. The dataset is designed to be fully reproducible using the provided framework, configurations, and fixed random seeds available in the repository. If you do not have the resources for such a large dataset, you can modify this `NumFrames` parameter to generate a smaller, more manageable dataset.**

This section outlines the basic workflow for generating a dataset using the CSRD framework.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csrd.git 
    cd csrd 
    ```

2.  **Download OSM Files (for Ray Tracing):**
    If you plan to use ray tracing for channel modeling, download the OpenStreetMap data. This script requires Python and the `requests` library.

    *   **Setup Python Environment (Recommended):**
        It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
        ```bash
        # Example: Create and activate a virtual environment
        python -m venv .venv
        # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
        # On Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
        
        pip install requests
        ```

    *   **Run the script:**
        ```bash
        cd tools
        python download_osm.py
        cd .. 
        ```
    This will save `.osm` files into the `appdata/map/osm` directory.

3.  **Configure Simulation Parameters:**
    Simulation scenarios, signal parameters, channel models, and other settings are typically defined in configuration files located within the `config/` directory. You may need to modify or create new configuration files in `config/` (potentially using files from `config/_base_/` as templates) to define your desired dataset parameters before running a simulation.

4.  **Run the Simulation:**

    *   **Single Simulation (Serial Execution):**
        For a basic simulation run or for debugging, you can execute the main simulation script directly in MATLAB:
        ```matlab
        % Navigate to the 'tools' directory in MATLAB
        cd tools;
        
        % Run the simulation (example: worker 1 of 1)
        % Ensure your simulation parameters are set in the appropriate config files.
        simulation(1, 1); 
        ```

    *   **Parallel Simulation (Multiple Workers):**
        For generating larger datasets, parallel execution is recommended. Use the provided scripts based on your operating system. These scripts will launch multiple MATLAB instances.

        *   **Windows:**
            Open a command prompt, navigate to the `tools` directory, and run:
            ```batch
            cd tools
            multi_simulation.bat
            ```
            You will be prompted to enter the number of workers.

        *   **Linux / macOS:**
            Open a terminal, navigate to the `tools` directory, and run:
            ```bash
            cd tools
            chmod +x multi_simulation.sh # Ensure the script is executable
            ./multi_simulation.sh
            ```
            You will be prompted to enter the number of workers.

        Logs for parallel simulations can be found in the `tools/logs` directory.

5.  **Convert Data to COCO Format:**
    After the simulation generates the raw signal data, you will typically need to process this data and convert it into the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset format. This format is widely used for object detection tasks, which in this context applies to signal localization and recognition.
    *(Further details or specific scripts for this conversion step should be added here if available.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

### OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data Downloader (`tools/download_osm.py`)

This Python script is provided to download OpenStreetMap data required for raytracing simulations. It queries the Overpass API for specific geographical scenes defined within the script and saves the results as `.osm` files.

**Dependencies:**

*   Python 3.x (It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment).
*   `requests` library. Install using pip: `pip install requests`.

**Usage:**

1.  Ensure you have Python and the `requests` library installed.
2.  Navigate to the `tools` directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd tools
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python download_osm.py
    ```
4.  The script will download OSM data for predefined scenes (e.g., Dense Urban, Historical City Center) and save them into categorized subdirectories within `appdata/map/osm`.

**Note:** The script includes predefined scene coordinates and categories. You can modify the `scenes` dictionary within `download_osm.py` to download data for different locations or adjust the `BOX_SIZE_KM` and other parameters as needed. Please be mindful of the Overpass API usage policy and the delay implemented in the script to avoid overloading the server.
