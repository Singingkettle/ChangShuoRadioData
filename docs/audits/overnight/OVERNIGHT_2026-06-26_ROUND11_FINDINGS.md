# Round 11 (2026-06-26): deeper 12-dimension EMPIRICAL bug hunt

Branch: `fix/message-source-modulation-binding` (PR #10, **not merged**).

A 12-dimension multi-agent hunt with an empirical-probing mandate (run the pipeline + capture real
signals + check physical plausibility, not just static reads — the approach that found the round-9 OBW
bug), batched 4 dimensions at a time to stay under API rate limits, with 3-angle adversarial verification
(correctness / physics / contract) + a completeness critic. **5 verified-real bugs; 4 fixed, 1 flagged.**

## Fixed (4)

| Commit | Finding | Sev | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `c31b225` | **FramePlane.TimeOccupancy degenerate constant 1.0** | high | the envelope window defaults to min(1e-4 s, frameDur); every frame is < 1e-4 s → one whole-frame window → TimeOccupancy always 1.0. Empirically all 1862 measured sources had FramePlane.TimeOccupancy = 1.0 (SourcePlane spanned 0.037–0.73). Pass an explicit ~1/32-frame `EnvelopeOptions.WindowSec` to the FramePlane call → real fraction (now {0.188, 0.625, 1.0}). Test `FramePlaneTimeOccupancyTest` |
| `c31b225` | **OFDM/OTFS/SCFDMA fallback Subcarrierspacing = 200/400 Hz** | high (partial) | the modulator fallbacks (fired when ModulatorConfig has no `base`) set 200/400 Hz SCS → realized OBW ~100× too narrow. Fixed all three to the standards 15 kHz SCS. Tiny (<1 MHz) multicarrier fell 48% → 26%; fallback now yields ~3.56 MHz. **Residual flagged below.** |
| `62fea97` | **FSK reports analytical BW = fsep·M** | med | under-reports realized OBW by ~33–47% for M ≥ 4 (Truth.Execution.AnalyticalBandwidthHz). Measure the realized OBW directly like every other family |
| `62fea97` | **Link-budget SNR omits Tx+Rx antenna gains** | med | `snr = txPower − pathLoss − noisePower` dropped Gtx + Grx. Add both (default 0). Affects Execution.AnalyticalSNRdB + distance-based realized SNR; controlled-SNR csrd2025 path unaffected |

## Flagged — need a focused dig (1 + 1 residual)

- **Residual multicarrier narrow-band** (HIGH) — **ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (option A, owner-approved).**
  The owner chose option A; implemented: `scs = min(max(15 kHz, 2/minBurst), bandwidth/12)` threaded
  through the modulation-config builders + the OTFS branch. Median realized/planned OBW went from
  ~0.015 (collapsed) to **0.99**. Residuals are fundamental OFDM-in-a-tiny-window feasibility limits
  (very short bursts can't resolve a full-bandwidth symbol; sub-180 kHz channels hit the >= 12-subcarrier
  floor) -- option B territory if ever needed. Original analysis below: After the 200/400 Hz fallback fix, ~26% of OFDM still realize ~586 kHz for a planned
  40 MHz. The earlier "grid not reaching the modulator" hypothesis was REFUTED by instrumentation: the
  OFDM modulators all use the correct grid (15 kHz SCS, FFT 1024/2048, SampleRate 15.36/30.72 MHz, 665/1331
  data subcarriers → a genuine 10–20 MHz signal). The real cause is a **symbol-vs-frame duration tension**:
  a 15 kHz OFDM symbol is 1/15 kHz = **66.7 µs**, but the dataset's frame durations are **20.5 / 41 / 82 µs**.
  So one OFDM symbol does not fit the 20.5/41 µs frames; the transmit gating truncates the OFDM to the
  burst extent (N=103–1638 ≈ 2–33 µs — a sub-symbol fragment), and a sub-symbol fragment's measured OBW
  collapses to ~586 kHz. To fit ≥1 symbol in the shortest 20.5 µs frame the SCS must be ≥ ~60 kHz
  (16.7 µs symbol). Fix options (owner decision — they change OFDM dataset characteristics):
  (A) **adapt the OFDM/OTFS/SCFDMA subcarrier spacing to the burst/frame duration** (spacing ≥ ~2/burstDur,
  ≥60–120 kHz here) so the symbol fits and the bandwidth still tracks (numUsed = bandwidth/spacing) —
  RECOMMENDED, keeps a valid wideband OFDM in every frame, deviates from LTE-exact 15 kHz (acceptable for
  a spectrum-sensing, non-protocol dataset); (B) constrain OFDM to bursts ≥ 1 symbol (standards-exact but
  drops OFDM from short frames); (C) lengthen the frames. The grid/builders are correct; this is purely
  the spacing-vs-frame fit.
- **OBW & center wrap the ±Fs/2 Nyquist edge** (MEDIUM, measurement): the contiguous-band search +
  centroid are not circular-aware, so an emitter whose band straddles ±Fs/2 is mis-measured. Fix:
  circular-arc span search + circular centroid. Edge case; deferred.

## Completeness critic (next-round lead)
PA spectral regrowth aliasing under insufficient oversampling: the memoryless nonlinearity (3rd-order
regrowth ~3× signal BW) runs on the baseband grid before resampling; if the oversampling margin is too
small the regrowth aliases. Concrete, testable, un-probed.

## Verification
`checkcode` clean on changed code; measurement + modulation + channel suites pass; end-to-end sim clean;
new tests `FramePlaneTimeOccupancyTest`. FramePlane.TimeOccupancy distinct values verified to span a real
range post-fix; fallback OFDM verified at 3.56 MHz (was 200/400 Hz × FFT).
