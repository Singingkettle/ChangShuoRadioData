Abstract of the paper: 

Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation
outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) in high-mobility scenarios. One challenge for OTFS
massive MIMO is downlink channel estimation due to the large
number of base station antennas. In this paper, we propose a 3D
structured orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm based channel
estimation technique to solve this problem. First, we show that the
OTFS MIMO channel exhibits 3D structured sparsity: normal
sparsity along the delay dimension, block sparsity along the
Doppler dimension, and burst sparsity along the angle dimension.
Based on the 3D structured channel sparsity, we then formulate
the downlink channel estimation problem as a sparse signal
recovery problem. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm can achieve accurate channel state information with
low pilot overhead.
